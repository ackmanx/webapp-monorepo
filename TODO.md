# Stuff I Gotta Do Still

* Each app should have a config or setup, that registers its routes and db
* Add dictionary app
* Put app-specific dependencies into their own package.json files
* Document how to deploy
* Document how url rewriting works
    * How do I route subdomains
    * How do I avoid needing /vocab/get-categories GET on the UI but that's the route in node
