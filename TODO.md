# Stuff I Gotta Do Still

* Route registration for each app should be automatic
    * Based off of apps/<app-name>

* (currently) All hosted app yarn scripts could be automated via shell being the only variance is directory

* Can make deploy script smarter
    * If a hosted app hasn't changed, no reason to re-build it
    * Need to version the code somehow that automatically updates
